ResComp is part of SGDK (aka Sega Genesis Dev Kit) so refer to SGDK licence if needed.

It allows to compile different type of resource and output them in assembly source form (GAS format).

Usage: rescomp resource.res [out.s] [-noheader]

If output file is not specified it takes the same name as input with .s extension.
Note that the header file (.h) is generated except if you use the -noheader parameter.

Supported resource type:
- BITMAP    bitmapped image type resource, used for the Bitmap SGDK engine (do not use it as tile resource).
- PALETTE   palette type resource, used as color input for Bitmap, Image or Sprite resource.
- TILESET   tileset type resource, contains tiles data which are used by Image or Sprite resource.
- MAP       map type resource.
- IMAGE     image type resource, internally contains Palette, Tileset and Map data and can be used to draw a complete background.
- SPRITE    sprite type resource, used to handle sprites with the SGDK Sprite engine.
- XGM       XGM music type resource (.vgm or .xgm file), used to play music.
- WAV       WAV sound type resource (.wav file), used to play sample sound data.
- BIN       any binary data file which do not need any specific conversion or processing.

Supported function:
- ALIGN     align *binary* data for the whole resource file using
- UNGROUP   by default rescomp will group data export by type, using UNGROUP allow to disable that feature.


PALETTE
-------
Take a .pal file or an image as input and transform it in SGDK Palette structure.
If the input image is 1 pixel heigth then the width is the palette size and pixel X represent color data at index X.
In others cases the usual image palette data is used instead.

Palette is used as color input for Bitmap, Image and Sprite resources.

Syntax:
PALETTE name file

    name            name of the output Bitmap structure
    file            path of the input image file (should be 8bpp .bmp or .png) or .pal file


BITMAP
------
Take an image as input and transform it in SGDK Bitmap structure.
Bitmap image structure is used for the SGDK BMP (bitmap) engine, do not use it for tiled image.

Syntax:
BITMAP name img_file [compression]

    name            name of the output Bitmap structure
    img_file        path of the input image file (should be 8bpp .bmp or .png)
    compression     compression type (use unpackBitmap(..) to unpack), accepted values:
                       -1 / BEST / AUTO = use best compression
                        0 / NONE        = no compression (default)
                        1 / APLIB       = aplib library (good compression ratio but slow)
                        2 / FAST / LZ4W = custom lz4 compression (average compression ratio but fast)


TILESET
-------
Take an image as input and transform it in SGDK TileSet structure.
TileSet is used as tiles source for Image and Sprite.

Syntax:
TILESET name img_file [compression]

    name            name of the output TileSet structure
    img_file        path of the input image file (should be 8bpp .bmp or .png)
    compression     compression type (use unpackTileSet(..) to unpack), accepted values:
                       -1 / BEST / AUTO = use best compression
                        0 / NONE        = no compression (default)
                        1 / APLIB       = aplib library (good compression ratio but slow)
                        2 / FAST / LZ4W = custom lz4 compression (average compression ratio but fast)


MAP
---
NOT YET SUPPORTED !
Take an map file as input and transform it in SGDK Map structure.
Map is used to define a complete background (plane) data.

Syntax:
MAP name map_file width height [compression]

    name            name of the output Map structure
    map_file        path of the input map file (not yet defined, mappy ?)
    width           width of the map in tile
    heigth          heigth of the map in tile
    compression     compression type (use unpackMap(..) to unpack), accepted values:
                       -1 / BEST / AUTO = use best compression
                        0 / NONE        = no compression
                        1 / APLIB       = aplib library (good compression ratio but slow)
                        2 / FAST / LZ4W = custom lz4 compression (average compression ratio but fast)


IMAGE
-----
Take an image as input and transform it in SGDK Image structure.
Image is used to directly draw image in background plan, it internally contains a Palette, TileSet and Map structure.

    compression     compression type (use unpackImage(..) to unpack), accepted values:
                       -1 / BEST / AUTO = use best compression
                        0 / NONE        = no compression
                        1 / APLIB       = aplib library (good compression ratio but slow)
                        2 / FAST / LZ4W = custom lz4 compression (average compression ratio but fast)
    mapopt          define the map optimisation level
                        0 / NONE        = no optimisation (each tile is unique)
                        1 / ALL         = find duplicate and flipped tile (default)
                        2 / DUPLICATE   = find duplicate tile only
    mapbase         define the base tilemap value, useful to set a default priority, palette and base tile index offset.
                    Using a base tile index offset (static tile allocation) allow to use the faster VDP_xxxTileMapxxx(..) functions.


SPRITE
------
Take an image as input and transform it in SGDK SpriteDefinition structure.
SpriteDefinition is used to draw, animate and manage sprites, it internally contains severals TileSet, Palette and Animation structures.

Syntax:
SPRITE name img_file width heigth [compression [time [collision [opt [iteration]]]]]

    name            name of the output SpriteDefinition structure
    img_file        path of the input image file (should be 8bpp .bmp or .png)
    width           width of a single sprite frame in tile (width * heigth <= 256)
    heigth          heigth of a single sprite frame in tile (width * heigth <= 256)
    compression     compression type, accepted values:
                       -1 / BEST / AUTO = use best compression
                        0 / NONE        = no compression
                        1 / APLIB       = aplib library (good compression ratio but slow, don't use it for streamed sprite)
                        2 / FAST / LZ4W = custom lz4 compression (average compression ratio but fast, recommended for streamed sprite)
    time            display frame time in 1/60 of second (time between each animation frame)
                       If this value is set to 0 (default) then auto animation is disabled
    collision       collision type: CIRCLE, BOX or NONE (NONE by default)
    opt             sprite cutting optimization strategy, accepted values:
                        0 / BALANCED  = balance between used tiles and hardware sprites (default)
                        1 / SPRITE    = reduce the number of hardware sprite (using bigger sprite) at the expense of more used tiles
                        2 / TILE      = reduce the number of tiles at the expense of more hardware sprite (using smaller sprite)
    iteration       number of iteration for sprite cutting optimization (default = 500000)

Some informations about how SpriteDefinition is generated from the input image:
- input image dimension is aligned on tile (multiple of 8).
- input image is a grid where each cell represents a single sprite frame and where a row define a complete sprite animation.
- cell size (frame size) = width * height (in tile) where width and height should be <= 16 (maximum = 128 pixels for both width and height)
- a frame can be composed of several internal VDP sprites but it stricly limited to a maximum of 16 sprites.
  If the sprite is too large to fit in 16 hardware sprites (rescomp will complain about it), then you may reduce its size or split it in 2.
- rescomp detects flipped frame to avoid redundant sprite tiles.
- rescomp detects empty frame at end of animation row to not store empty frame data.
- rescomp try to optimize hardware sprites and vRAM usage by detecting empty areas in sprite frames.
- rescomp detects frame copy inside an animation to generate the according animation sequence.
- by default collision bounds are calculated by using 75% of the original sprite frame.


XGM
---
Take a .vgm or .xgm music file as input and transform it in binary format usable with the SGDK SND_startPlay_XGM(..) methods.
The XGM driver supports music play along 4 PCM channels mixing (100% running on Z80 cpu).

Syntax:
XGM name file [timing [options]]

    name            XGM music variable name
    file            path of the .vgm or .xgm music file to convert to binary data array
    timing          define the XGM base timing
                       -1 (default) = AUTO (NTSC or PAL depending the information in source VGM/XGM file)
                        0           = NTSC (XGM is generated for NTSC system)
                        1           = PAL (XGM is generated for PAL system)
    options         optional(s) parameter(s) for xgmtool
                        ex: "-dr -di" to disable some sample auto process (see xgmtool to get more info)


WAV

                        2 / 3 / 4PCM
                            4 channels 8 bits signed sample driver with volume support.
                            It can mix up to 4 samples (8 bit signed) at a fixed 16 Khz rate.
                            with volume support (16 levels du to memory limitation).

                        By default the default WAV output rate is used.


BIN
---
Take any data file as input and transform it in binary data array accessible through SGDK.

Syntax:
BIN name file [align [salign [fill [compression [far]]]]]

    name            BIN data variable name
    file            path of the data file to convert to binary data array
    align           memory address alignment for generated data array (default is 2)
    salign          size alignment for the generated data array (default is 2)
    fill            fill value for the size alignment (default is 0)
    compression     compression type, accepted values:
                       -1 / BEST / AUTO = use best compression
                        0 / NONE        = no compression
                        1 / APLIB       = aplib library (good compression ratio but slow)
                        2 / FAST / LZ4W = custom lz4 compression (average compression ratio but fast)
    far             'far' binary data flag to put it at the end of the ROM (useful for bank switch, default = TRUE)


ALIGN
-----
Align *binary* data for the *whole* resource file so you can have only ALIGN directive per resource (.res) file.
ALIGN function is useful when using bank switch for ROM larger than 4MB, it allows to avoid having a block of data crossing 2 data banks.
If you need several data alignments then you have to use several resources files.
Note that if you omit [value] parameter by default data is aligned on 512KB as this is the bank size when using bank switch mechanism.

Syntax:
ALIGN [value]

    value           specifies the minimum binary data alignment in bytes (default is 524288 = bank size)


UNGROUP
-------
By default rescomp will group data export by type of data, this generally allow better LZ4W compression.
Using UNGROUP function allow to disable that feature, that might be useful to help in bank data separation when using the bank switch mechanism.

Syntax:
UNGROUP
